CI/CD Pipeline

When we update or push code to the Git repository, Git-webhook will notify Jenkins. Jenkins will then trigger the first job, which will:

    Pull the source code to the local machine.
    Compile the code using Maven and run SonarQube analysis.
    Deploy the WAR file to the Nexus artifact repository.

The first job will then trigger the second job, which will:

    Download the latest WAR file from the Nexus artifact repository.
    Transfer the WAR file to another server using Ansible playbook.
    Start the Tomcat server on the other server.

Once the Tomcat server is started, our web page will be accessible from the web.
